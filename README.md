## Careem
### The role offered was for a Senior Business Analyst position within the food vertical. The role's requirements were as followed:
For a super app like Careem offering multiple services, we as the food growth team need to ensure that our vertical is growing. As a growth and analytics person, what are the KPIs you would look at in order to ensure you have an end-to-end view of how the business is performing? Keep in mind that food is a 3 way marketplace between customers, merchants and captains.

Prepare a dashboard using dummy data on any platform of your choice with the relevant KPIs and corresponding frequency of viewing these KPIs.

If you were looking at these numbers daily:
1. What leading indicators would inform you of a potential problem statement?
⋅⋅⋅Prepare two scenarios
2. How would you solve the problem along with the help product, marketing and operations?

## Please note that the data is not real and has been generated using fictional numbers.
